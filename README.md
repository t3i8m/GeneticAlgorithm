In the framework of this work, modelling of evolution and determination of optimal parameters of the genetic algorithm for the string "HELLO WORLD '' was carried out. The technique involves initialisation of a specific number of population of random strings, evaluation of their suitability by the number of character matches with the target string and application of selection, crossover and mutation operators to create a new generation.
The following questions were used to compare and identify effective parameters:

What is the influence of a larger/smaller population? Is there a difference in the number of generations needed to find a solution?
What is the influence of a larger/smaller mutation rate? Is there a difference in the number of generations needed to find a solution?
Now leave out the crossover operator. Is there a difference in the number of generations needed to find a solution?
Does GA still work without mutations? Why or why not?
